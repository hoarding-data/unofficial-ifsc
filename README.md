This project utilized the work of https://github.com/stanrusak/climbingstats for gathering the event data.

This is only adult standard w/c data (no youth, no paraclimbing at this time).

I am not including the base file "full_data.json" because it is large, but you can generate it using his repository if the combined format is of more use to you.

2023 is missing Seoul which I believe is due to weather. Only 1 of four recordings appears to be available on youtube. Also a lot of the continental qualifiers for 2024 olympics
2020 I can't find recordings for some of the continental events.
2019 is missing Hachioji which is the championship and Toulouse which was a qualifier event.
